            "Mayor Walsh presented a balanced budget that maintains high levels of support in critical areas such as education and public safety, makes limited strategic investments, continues the City's commitment to addressing its long-term liabilities, and builds on the Administration's record of strong fiscal management. This is made possible by the Administration's achievement of efficiencies and savings. The City's data-driven managerial approach was recently validated by the affirmation of Boston's triple A bond rating."
