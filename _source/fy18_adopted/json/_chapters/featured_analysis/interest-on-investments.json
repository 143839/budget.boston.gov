            "In general, the City&rsquo;s level of investment income is a function of prevailing short-term interest rates and daily cash balances. Since 2007, interest rates have been reduced in an effort to stimulate the economy. Given the very low interest earnings potential of recent years, the Treasury department had instead engaged in a compensating balance approach with banks, having fees paid through depositing minimum balances. Investment income totaled $61 thousand in FY15 and $184.3 thousand in FY16. The City projects interest income will exceed the $200 thousand budgeted in FY17. ",
            "In FY18 the City will reduce the amount required to maintain a compensating balance (due to the need to offset credit card fees becoming unnecessary), and instead invest this money. By standardizing practices and adding fees to the cost of point of sale transactions, revenue from Interest on Investments is estimated to increase to $2 million."
