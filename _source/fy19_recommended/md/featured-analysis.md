      Through operational reviews, data-driven initiatives, and
      other planning efforts, the Walsh Administration has 
      identified need for investment in key areas. Cards below.
    description: >
      Mayor Walsh presented a balanced budget that maintains 
      high levels of support in critical areas such as education and public safety, makes limited strategic investments,continues the City's commitment to addressing its long-term liabilities, and builds on the Administration's record of strong fiscal management. This is made possible by the Administration's achievement of efficiencies and savings. The City's data-driven managerial approach was recently validated by the affirmation of Boston's triple A bond rating.
