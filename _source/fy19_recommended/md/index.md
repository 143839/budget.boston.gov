    body: >
      Mayor Martin J. Walsh’s Fiscal Year 2019 (FY19) budget affirms a commitment to progress, opportunity and innovation by investing in Boston’s neighborhoods while maintaining the Mayor’s strong record of financial management. The $3.29 billion plan is balanced, sustainable, and accelerates progress across public policy areas. The budget contains historic levels of funding for public education, new investments in public safety, continued efforts to create affordable and middle income housing, expanded services for residents struggling with substance use disorders and addiction, and new initiatives that will transform the future of transportation in Boston.

      <h5>Spending</h5>
      <p>Boston is a growing city, with an evolving population that needs new and expanded city services. In his first term in office, Mayor Walsh improved outcomes across the City’s services, from education to housing, economic security to quality of life, and open space to the arts. In FY19, the Mayor proposes to build on those successes and make real, meaningful changes to the future of Boston’s landscape. Investments in public safety, education, transportation, housing, public health, and many other areas reflect a City committed to providing the services to <strong>expand opportunity and security to Boston’s middle class</strong>.</p>
      <h5>Revenue</h5>
      <p>Boston’s expanding economy is generating growing revenue to support investments in city neighborhoods. Property tax growth remains the main driver and far exceeds previous growth realized in the City. Local receipts, such as fines, fees and excise tax also continue to grow modestly as a result of an expanding economy. The City continues to weather reductions to net State aid, a decade-long trend of disinvestment driven by modest growth in State aid revenue and large increases in State assessments.</p>
      <h5>Maintaining fiscal discipline</h5>
      <p>The commitment Mayor Walsh made to fiscal responsibility at the beginning of his Administration is yielding tangible results. The City’s efforts to control health care costs have saved $50 million since FY15, its pension liability is on track to be fully paid by 2025, faster than most Massachusetts cities, and City services are more efficient, effective and responsive to the needs of Boston’s residents than ever before. The FY19 budget continues those steps by:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Paying down the City’s long-term liabilities</li>
      <li>Controlling fixed costs and health insurance</li>
      <li>Data-based new investments</li>
      <li>Proactive fiscal management</li>
      <li>maximizing revenue from local revenue</li>
      <li>Growing in-line with the City's projected revenue growth</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In their credit rating affirming Boston’s AAA rating with a stable outlook, Moody’s wrote: <blockquote>"The AAA rating reflects the city's strong fiscal management and stable financial position."</blockquote></p>
      <p>Disciplined financial practices have better positioned Boston to manage through changes in local, state, and federal policy and funding levels.</p>
      </ul>

      <h5>From idea to action</h5>
      <p>Over 14,000 Boston voices shaped the Mayor’s vision for Boston in 2030. They envisioned a city that will expand opportunity for all, support a dynamic economy, enhance quality of life, and prepare for climate change. Imagine Boston 2030 identifies key areas where Boston can take action to:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Enhance neighborhoods’ vitality;</li>
      <li>Encourage mixed-use job centers;</li>
      <li>Provide spaces for new housing and jobs as we grow;</li>
      <li>Create a waterfront for future generations; and</li>
      <li>Connect historically underserved neighborhoods to more opportunities.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Investing in core goals</h5>
      <p>Mayor Walsh’s $2.43 billion FY9-FY23 Capital Plan moves Boston residents’ priorities from idea to action, and invests in creating the city Bostonians imagine for the future. An estimated 84% of projects in the FY19-23 Capital Plan are aligned with the City’s planning efforts:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Last year, Mayor Walsh committed $1 billion over ten years to bring Boston's school buildings into the 21st Century. After spending close to $100 million in the first year, this Plan sets the stage for continued investment in 21st century classrooms, new and expanded schools, new kitchens to serve fresh food, school safety upgrades and funding for future projects coming out of the BuildBPS community engagement process.</li>
      <li>Boston, in collaboration with State and Federal sources, will invest $967 million over the next five years in implementing the core initiatives outlined in Go Boston 2030: streets that are safer for all users of our roads and sidewalks, travel that is more reliable and predictable, and quality transportation choices that improve access to interconnect our neighborhoods for all modes of travel. </li>
      <li>Through the use of Winthrop Square proceeds, City capital dollars, and leveraging external funds, Mayor Walsh plans to carry out early actions to implement Imagine Boston 2030’s Open Space goals, including investing in Franklin Park as a keystone park for the city, completing the Emerald Necklace, and restoring Boston Common to its full vibrancy.</li>
      <li>Boston will prepare for climate change by investing City dollars and outside funding to develop more detailed climate plans for Boston neighborhoods, especially those most at risk for coastal flooding, as recommended in Climate Ready Boston.</li>
      <li>Continuing the Percent for Art Program, funded for the first time in last years Capital Plan, demonstrates the City’s leadership and commitment to sustainable funding for the commissioning of public art.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>With investments in roads, bridges, schools, libraries, parks, firehouses, and community centers, the Imagine Boston Capital Plan touches each neighborhood and shapes a City that over 14,000 voices told us they want to see.</p>
