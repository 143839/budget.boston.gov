  - title: Transforming the Future of Transportation
  body: >
    Mayor Walsh released Go Boston 2030 in March 2017 to push Boston for streets and sidewalks that are safer, travel that is more    reliable and predictable, and quality transportation choices that improve access and interconnect our neighborhoods for all modes of travel. Driven by these core goals of safety, reliability, equity and access, Mayor Walshâ€™s FY19 operating and FY19-FY23 capital budget dedicates transformational funding for transportation projects. By increasing certain parking fines in FY19, the City will produce positive results by changing driver behavior and reducing congestion in high traffic areas, as well as allow the City to make $5 million in signature investments in transportation projects.

      <h5>Investing in Streets & Signals</h5>
      <p>A subset of the $5 million investment is focused on improving the basics of the City's 800 miles of streets, 1,600 miles of sidewalks, and over 800 traffic signals.

      <h5>Repairing sidewalks</h5>
      <p>This FY18 budget builds on past investments in basic city services that have improved 
      quality of life in Boston. As a result of accelerated resurfacing and sidewalk repair in 
      FY17, the percentage of requests for sidewalk repairs addressed on time (within 48 
      hours) increased from 66% in December 2015 to 85% in December 2016.</p>
