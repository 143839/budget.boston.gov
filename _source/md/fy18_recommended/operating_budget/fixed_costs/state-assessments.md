      Aside from the assessments for Charter School Tuition and the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) state assessment growth is relatively small. In accordance with Proposition 2 1/2, these charges, except for Charter School Tuition, cannot increase by more than 2.5% annually on a statewide basis.
