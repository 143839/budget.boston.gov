            "Boston&rsquo;s Pension budget is based on the current pension schedule approved by Boston&rsquo;s Retirement Board. The City&rsquo;s Pension schedule requires an $22 million or 11.0% increase in FY18 in part due to generations of underfunding the City&rsquo;s Pension obligations and in part due to a cost-of-living adjustment for its retirees.",
            "The City of Boston participates in a contributory defined benefit retirement system that is administered by the Boston Retirement System (BRS). BRS is one of 106 public pension systems governed by Massachusetts General Law Chapter 32. Boston&rsquo;s current pension schedule is based on an actuarial asset valuation as of January 1, 2016. The current pension schedule assumes a long term rate of return of 7.75%. The City&rsquo;s pension liability is currently 74.96% funded and is on track to reduce the unfunded liability to zero by 2025, fifteen years prior to the legally required funding date of 2040."
