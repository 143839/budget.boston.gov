      Based on a reform launched by Mayor Walsh in 2015, the district has been 
      extending the school day for kindergarten through 8th grade schools over 
      three years.
    description: >
      In the 2017-2018 school year, Boston is investing $14.2 million to allow 
      39 more schools and 15,000 more students to receive 40 minutes more each school 
      day through the implementation of Extended Learning Time (ELT). <blockquote>This 
      expansion brings the total number of students receiving extended learning to over 
      23,000 at 57 schools throughout the District at a total investment of $18.9 
      million.</blockquote>
