Continuing trends seen in recent years, the Mayor&rsquo;s proposed FY18 budget relies on growth in property tax and other local receipt revenue, but requires control of growth in departmental spending to offset weak state aid revenue and high fixed cost growth. Budgetary growth is maintained at a responsible level given the need to maintain flexibility in the face of continuing uncertainty at other levels of government. Despite these challenges, the budget makes strong statements about the City&rsquo;s priorities, as is reflected in the proposed investments. "
