            "Of that growth, Boston Public Schools is increasing by $40.3 million (3.9%) with a $1.061 billion appropriation and $20 million collective bargaining reserve. Boston&rsquo;s total investment in education is growing by $57.8 million (4.8%), including BPS and the City&rsquo;s Charter School Assessment.",
            "City Services such as Police, Fire, Public Works, Housing and Public Health are projected to increase by a total of $54.0 million (4.3%), including funding reserved for collective bargaining. Public safety costs are rising by 3.5% in FY18. Streets cabinet departments, Public Health Commission and 37 other departments are increasing by an average of 1.5%. Twenty-three of these departments will see a reduction in their appropriation in FY18. Funding for City collective bargaining costs are centralized in a $27 million collective bargaining reserve. In addition, health insurance costs are projected to increase by $10.6 million (5.2%), even after achieving health care cost containment savings.",
