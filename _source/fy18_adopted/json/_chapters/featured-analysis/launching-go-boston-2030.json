            "Mayor Walsh&rsquo;s FY18-22 Capital Plan, drawing on City, State and Federal sources, will invest $709 million over the next five years in implementing the core initiatives outlined in Go Boston 2030. Under Go Boston 2030, Boston will strive for streets that are safer for all users of our roads and sidewalks, particularly pedestrians and cyclists; travel that is more reliable and predictable, and quality transportation choices that improve access, to interconnect our neighborhoods for all modes of travel. Driven by these core goals of safety, reliability, and access, the capital plan focuses on the following key investments:",
            "Launches a citywide, multi-year campaign to bring all crosswalks, lane markings, and bike lanes into a state of good repair.",
            "Continues the City&rsquo;s $3.1 million annual investment in Vision Zero to make targeted safety improvements at corridors and intersections with known safety challenges, and to traffic-calm residential streets.",
            "Improves access and safety for those visiting our Main Street business districts on foot and on bicycles including Hyde Square, Central Square and Dudley Street. ",
            "Starts the transformation of the City&rsquo;s upgrade to the next generation of traffic signal technology, with an initial focus on some of our busiest corridors and bus routes. This will mean fewer delays for everyone and better coordination across signals.",
            "Focuses on adding protected bicycle lanes on every &ldquo;Great Streets&rdquo; project, including Melnea Cass Boulevard and Commonwealth Avenue, and on Multi-Use Paths such as the Fenway-Roxbury Connector, all complemented by continuing the $900,000 annual investment in the Strategic Bike Network. ",
            "Funds a multi-year program to create improved and - in many cases - signalized intersections in some of the more challenging locations in the City. This includes the Father Hart Bridge/Wolcott Square area in Hyde Park.",
            "Puts the City on a sustainable capital program to maintain bridges, roads, sidewalks, off-street paths, street lighting, and building facilities essential to the high-quality delivery of services."
