      The City of Boston's budgeting process takes at least 6 months to do, but 
      that doesn't mean you can't understand it in 90 seconds. Below, find a 
      quick video overview of how Boston's budget works. If you want more detail, 
      read the text below the video.

  - title: Who makes decisions about the budget?
    body: >
      <p>The City of Boston’s budget process is governed by the City’s Charter* and practices designed to provide transparency and gather public feedback. 
      The chief executive officer of the City is the Mayor. Martin J. Walsh, the 
      Mayor of the City, was elected to serve his first term from January 2014 
      through January 2018. The Mayor has general supervision of and control over 
      the City’s boards, commissions, officers, and departments. The portion of 
      the budget covering appropriations for all departments and operations of 
      the City, except the Boston Public Schools, is prepared under the direction 
      of the Mayor. The Boston Public Schools follow a separate process which 
      requires the Superintendent of Schools to propose a budget to the School 
      Committee. The Superintendent submits the School Committee approved budget 
      to the Mayor. The Mayor submits a recommended budget, including the Boston 
      Public Schools budget, to the City Council.</p>
      <p>The legislative body of the City is the Boston City Council, which consists 
      of thirteen members serving two-year terms. Four councilors are elected at-large 
      and nine are elected from geographic districts. The City Council may enact 
      ordinances and adopt orders that the Mayor may either approve or veto. Ordinances 
      and orders, except orders for the borrowing or appropriation of money, may be 
      enacted by the City Council over the Mayor’s veto by a two-thirds vote. The 
      City Council may reject or reduce a budget submitted to it by the Mayor, but 
      may not increase it.</p>
      <p>* Chapter 486 of the Acts of 1909, and Chapter 452 of the Acts of 1948 of the 
      Commonwealth which, as amended, constitute the City’s Charter.</p>

    body: >
      <p>The City of Boston presents a fully integrated budget - including capital, 
      operating, and external funds - to show the total funding available to 
      departments to fulfill their missions. The operating budget funds personnel 
      and nonpersonnel expenses to departments so that they may provide important 
      city services. The capital budget funds new construction or renovations to 
      existing city-owned facilities (e.g., police and fire stations, school 
      buildings), infrastructure improvements (e.g., roads, sidewalks, lights), 
      and major equipment purchases such as fire-fighting apparatus. The external 
      funds budget describes the projects and programs that will be undertaken in 
      the next fiscal year with funding received from the state, federal, or other 
      non-general fund sources.</p>

  - title: Organization of the Budget
    body: >
      <p>The City of Boston’s program budget provides information related to City 
      services and theirassociated costs. The operating and capital budgets present 
      the recommended resource allocations in terms of personnel, facilities, goods, 
      and services. The budget document also describes the services provided by each 
      City department and the performance targets that have been set for FY17.</p>
      <h5>Departmental Operating Budgets</h5>
      <p>Activities and services of the City are grouped into programs for budgeting 
      and management purposes. The operating budget for each department is presented 
      by program. A “program” is defined as an organized group of activities directed 
      toward attaining one or more related objectives, and the resources to execute 
      them.</p>
      <p>A program can consist of direct services to the public and neighborhoods of 
      the City (e.g. police patrol or tree maintenance), or traditional city staff 
      functions (e.g. administrative services or engineering and design). Some City 
      activities may not be defined as separate programs, even though they may be 
      selfcontained operations. For example, a fire station is not a separate program, 
      although for accounting purposes it is a cost center within the Fire Department’s 
      Fire Suppression program. Program budgets serve as the basic building blocks of 
      the budget. There are three additional organizational levels above the program 
      level in the budget. The three levels are:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>The Division Level for units within some departments.</li>
      <li>The Department Level, which includes departments, commissions, and other 
      offices.</li>
      <li>The Cabinet Level, which includes functionallyrelated departments.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Description of Organization and Definition of Categories</h5>
      <p>This section outlines the information reported within each department and 
      program in the budget.</p>
      <h5>Department or Division Level</h5>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>Department Mission:</strong> The mission statement is a fundamental 
      statement of purpose.</li>
      <li><strong>Performance Strategies:</strong> These strategies reflect stated 
      goals for which the department or division is held accountable.</li>
      <li><strong>Description of Services:</strong> The description of services provides 
      a general overview of the department and its responsibilities, and lists examples 
      of major services provided.</li>
      <li><strong>Authorizing Statutes:</strong> This section lists statutes and 
      ordinances that create departments as well as endow them with legal powers.</li>
      <li><strong>Operating Budget:</strong> The operating budget presentation includes 
      a table displaying total operating and external budgets by program beginning with 
      FY14 actual expenses through the FY17 budget.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Program Level</h5>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>Program Description:</strong> This section presents a general overview 
      of the program, including its responsibilities and major services provided.</li>
      <li><strong>Program Strategies:</strong> Each program identifies its strategies to 
      further the department’s mission.</li>
      <li><strong>Performance Measures:</strong> Performance measures demonstrate a 
      program’s progress in implementing their strategies. Performance measures may gauge 
      workload, effectiveness, efficiency, or productivity. Some performance measures also 
      show the changing context in which programs are working.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Financial Data</h5>
      <p>The financial data tables identify the major groups and expenditure account codes 
      (for example, Personnel Services/Overtime, Supplies and Materials/Office Supplies), 
      historical expenditures in each, and the proposed appropriations in each group and 
      account in FY17. Two financial data sheets are provided for the FY17 operating 
      budget: Department History and Department Personnel.</p>
      <h5>Department History</h5>

      <li>FY16 appropriations,</li>
      <li>FY17 adopted budgets, and</li>
      <li>The difference between the FY16 appropriation and the FY17 adopted appropriation.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Department Personnel Data</h5>
      <p>Personnel data shows funding for permanent positions, including existing and proposed 
      positions. All permanent positions are listed by union and salary grade within the

      shown at the bottom right of the personnel sheet, reflects the amount of funding 
      required to support personnel prior to adjustments. This figure may be adjusted by 
      differential payments, other payments, chargebacks, and salary savings.</li>
      <li><strong>Differential Payments:</strong> Employees who are serving temporary job 
      titles or who are entitled to additional payments based on the shifts they work (e.g., 
      night shifts) receive differential payments. This figure is added to the permanent 
      employee line.</li>
      <li><strong>Other:</strong> The permanent employee line contains other payments such 
      as sick leave and vacation buybacks.</li>
      <li><strong>Chargebacks:</strong> Some personnel costs are charged to another fund or 
      appropriation. These costs or reimbursements are included in the permanent employee line.</li>
      <li><strong>Salary Savings:</strong> This figure reflects savings due to vacancies. The 
      amount is estimated based on experience in prior fiscal years and subtracted from the total 
      salary requirements.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>External Funds</h5>
      <p>The financial data identify the major groups and expenditure account codes for external 
      funds expenditures. Historical expenditures and the proposed appropriations in these 
      accounts in FY17 are shown. The personnel data show permanent positions, including 
      existing and proposed positions, funded with external funds. All permanent positions are 
      listed by union and grade within the department or division. The total salary request is 
      listed for these positions by job title. The External Funds Projects page lists a 
      description of each project’s mission.</p>
      <h5>Capital Budget</h5>

      <p>Following this overview are capital project profiles, including descriptions of each 
      project mission, the department managing the project, the status and location of each 
      project, and if there are operating budget impacts. A table summarizes the total capital 
      funds authorized for projected expenditures in FY17 and for future years, as well as whether 
      the source is City authorization or other funding such as federal and state infrastructure 
      grants or trust funds. A listing of actual and planned capital expenditures in comparison
