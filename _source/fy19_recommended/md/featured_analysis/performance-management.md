      Boston’s Performance Management efforts, driven in partnership between the Citywide 
      Analytics Team and the Office of Budget Management, exist to ensure that the city delivers the most
      effective and efficient services possible.
    description: >
      We work with departments across the City to solve challenging problems, build a more 
      effective government, and deliver better outcomes for people who live and work in Boston. 
      This page highlights our approach, recent accomplishments, and plans for the upcoming year.

  - col: >
      <h5>Executive Insight</h5>
      <p>One of our top priorities is providing City leadership with performance data where and 
      when they need it. We provide the Mayor, Cabinet Chiefs, and City leadership with dashboards 
      and reports that provide up-to-date information so they can stay regularly informed about 
      the effectiveness of programs, day-to-day operations, and progress toward accomplishing 
      strategic goals.</p>
  - col: >
      <h5>Optimizing Process</h5>
      <p>Along with building the tools to understand how well the City is performing, we work 
      collaboratively across 14 Cabinets to help identify pain points and develop immediate and potential 
      long-term performance and process improvements. These direct engagements create lasting improvements 
      for the City.</p>
  - col: >
      <h5>Engaging with the Public</h5>
      <p>The public plays a critical role in our work. To promote transparency, we publish City and 
      departmental performance scorecards so people can see how the City is performing at delivering 
      services, and to encourage innovation, we share our data so the public can create new tools and 
      propose new ways for the City to deliver services.</p>

      <h5>What Works Cities Certification</h5>
      <p>Boston was one of nine U.S. cities awarded certification from Bloomberg Philanthropies’ What Works Cities program. The program recognizes our commitment to the use of data and analytics to improve residents’ quality of life.</p>
      <p>Through What Works Cities, Boston will share insights with a community of peers, </p>
  - col: >
      <p>helping cities lead the way on big challenges ranging from equity to climate change.</p>
         <h5>EMS Community Assistance Teams</h5>
      <p>As part of our ongoing collaboration with Boston EMS, we assisted with the creation of a new Community Assistance Team to provide specialized care for residents dealing with issues such as substance abuse and homelessness.</p>

      <h5>Imagine Boston 2030</h5>
      <p>We designed a set of dashboards to visualize progress in implementing the City’s Imagine Boston 2030 plan. These visualizations use data to help illustrate where we stand on the goals set by the Imagine Boston 2030 plan, and will be updated annually. Going forward, the tool will help the public to understand long-term trends affecting quality of life in Boston, such as housing costs, economic opportunity, and public health and safety.</p>
