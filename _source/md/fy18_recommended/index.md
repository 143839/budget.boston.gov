      "I am proud to put forth a budget that makes strategic 
      investments to support Boston's neighborhoods, and builds 
      on our strong record of fiscal management." - Mayor 
      Martin J. Walsh
    description: >
      Mayor Martin J. Walsh today presented his Fiscal Year 2018 (FY18) budget 
      proposal, a plan that balances sustainability and increases investments 
      in key initiatives and more fully supports Boston's neighborhoods. The 
      proposed budget:
      <ul>
      <li>builds on the Walsh Administration's strong fiscal 
      management record;</li>
      <li>maintains high levels of support for educating Boston's students 
      and keeping the City of Boston safe;</li>
      <li>expands upon strategic initiatives to achieve cost savings; and</li>
      <li>positions the City to manage through instability at the national level.</li>

  - title: Introduction
    body: >
      Mayor Martin J. Walsh’s proposed $3.14 billion Fiscal Year 2018 (FY18) budget 
      balances sustainability, increased investment, and fiscal responsibility. Continuing 
      trends seen in recent years, the Mayor’s proposed FY18 budget relies on growth in 
      property tax and other local receipt revenue, but requires control of growth in 
      departmental spending to offset weak state aid revenue and high fixed cost growth. 
      Budgetary growth is maintained at a responsible level given the need to maintain 
      flexibility in the face of continuing uncertainty at other levels of government. Despite 
      these challenges, the budget makes strong statements about the City’s priorities, as is 
      reflected in the proposed investments.

  - col: >
      <h5>Expaning on savings</h5>
      <p>Even with strong growth in locally derived revenues, it is only through continued 
      tightening within City departments that the City will be able to afford new and expanded 
      investments after reserving for costs associated with collective bargaining, being 
      assessed for its increasing charter school costs, funding its pension obligations, 
      and paying its debt service. <blockquote>The FY18 proposal builds off of past budgets by 
      expanding savings initiatives, and allows for dollars to be used in high impact 
      areas.</blockquote></p>
      <h5>Federal challenges</h5>
      <p>Mayor Walsh’s FY18 budget stands in contrast to national efforts to dismantle the 
      urban safety net, as seen in the proposed Federal budget. The President has proposed 
      to eliminate critical federal programs that support the production of affordable housing, 
      revitalize Boston’s Main Streets, make heating bills affordable to 20,000 Boston
      residents, and provide Boston students with valuable after-school programs.</p>
  - col: >
      <h5>Taking advantage of data</h5>
      <p>In contrast, Mayor Walsh is proposing data-driven investments that meet the core 
      needs of Bostonians, including:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>targeting research-backed education investments - including extending the 
      school day for 15,000 students - to close achievement and opportunity gaps;</li>
      <li>directing educational resources to students most in need, including 3,000 
      BPS students experiencing homelessness;</li>
      <li>building on early success from the Mayor’s homeless action plan implementation;</li>
      <li>further extending access to addiction treatment services;</li>
      <li>using data to change the way Boston deploys emergency services to Boston 
      Common and Recovery Road;</li>
      <li>making sure that city streets in every neighborhood are clean and safe with 
      revitalized lane markings and crosswalks;</li>
      <li>continuing efforts to diversify Boston’s Police force by adding police 
      cadets;</li>
      <li>ensuring that Boston’s open spaces are among the nation’s most equitable 
      and accessible;</li>
      <li>supporting local artists through grantmaking and residencies;</li>
      <li>launching infrastructure projects driven by Imagine Boston 2030 and Go Boston 
      2030, moving from engagement and planning to action; and</li>
      <li>setting funding aside for future projects coming out of the BuildBPS engagement 
      process and partnerships with the Massachusetts School Building Authority (MSBA).</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>City approach vs. federal approach</h5>
      <p>The City’s data-driven investment and spending reform approach to budgeting 
      illustrates an alternative to the type of budget being contemplated at the Federal 
      level. The City’s spending approach continues to emphasize the preservation and 
      expansion of offerings to our most vulnerable residents, made possible by the 
      implementation of strategic reforms. <blockquote>In this budget, the City is avoiding 
      $60 million in costs through reforms implemented since Mayor Walsh’s first 
      budget.</blockquote> These strategic savings initiatives allow Boston to meet its 
      fixed cost obligations and make targeted investments in a thriving, healthy, and 
      innovative city. Conversely, the President’s proposed budget would eliminate valuable 
      programs aiding some of our most vulnerable residents.</p>
  - col: >
      <h5>Effects of state and federal budget</h5>
      <p>Boston faces increased uncertainty due to national and state level challenges. 
      In addition to federal budget proposals to eliminate over $24 million in Community 
      Development Block Grant funds flowing through the City of Boston, the President has 
      signed an executive order aimed at cutting funding for “Sanctuary Cities,” and has 
      supported health care legislation that would have created over a $1 billion hole in 
      the Commonwealth of Massachusetts’ budget. Further federal divestment from its Public 
      Housing Authority is also possible, and reduced federal education grants to serve 
      students in poverty have been proposed.</p>
      <p>At the state level, Boston continues to struggle with the Commonwealth’s underfunding 
      of the Charter School Tuition Reimbursement, from which the City is projected to lose 
      $25 million in FY18 alone.</p>
  - col: >
      <h5>Maintaining fiscal discipline</h5>
      <p>Cities cannot afford to replace this level of funding cuts, and Massachusetts 
      communities, with revenue tightly constrained by state law, will be particularly challenged 
      in the event of federal or state divestment. This instability from the federal and state 
      level requires increased stability and strong fiscal management at the City level. Mayor 
      Walsh’s FY18 budget continues the fiscal discipline that was recently praised by 
      rating agencies by:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>paying down the City’s long-term pension and OBEB obligations;</li>
      <li>managing personnel and health costs;</li>
      <li>continuing savings initiatives;</li>
      <li>maintaining conservative fiscal management policies; and</li>
      <li>maximizing revenue from local receipt sources.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In their credit rating affirming Boston’s Aaa rating with a stable outlook, Moody’s 
      wrote: "The AAA rating reflects the city's strong fiscal management and stable 
      financial position." Disciplined financial practices have better positioned Boston 
      to manage through changes in state and federal policy and funding levels.</p>

    body: >
      Over 14,000 Boston voices shaped the Mayor’s vision for Boston in 2030. They envisioned a city 
      that will expand opportunity for all, support a dynamic economy, enhance quality of life, and 
      prepare for climate change.
- text_col_2:
   - col: >
      <h5>From idea to action</h5>
      <p>Imagine Boston 2030 identifies key areas where Boston can take action to:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>enhance neighborhoods’ vitality;</li>
      <li>encourage mixed-use job centers;</li>
      <li>provide spaces for new housing and jobs as we grow;</li>
      <li>create a waterfront for future generations; and</li>
      <li>connect historically underserved neighborhoods to more opportunities.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Mayor Walsh’s $2.08 billion FY18-FY22 Capital Plan moves Boston residents’
      priorities from idea to action, and invests in creating the city Bostonians imagine 
      for the future. Under the Imagine Boston 2030 umbrella, the City is investing deeply 
      in the core goals of BuildBPS, Go Boston 2030, Boston Creates, and Climate 
      Ready Boston.</p>

       <p>Mayor Walsh’s $2.08 billion FY18-FY22 Capital Plan moves Boston residents’ priorities 
       from idea to action, and invests in creating the city Bostonians imagine for the future. 
       Under the Imagine Boston 2030 umbrella, the City is investing deeply in the core goals

      <p>An estimated 77% of projects in the FY18-22 Capital Plan are aligned with the 
      City’s planning efforts:</p>
- text_col_2:
    - col: >
        <ul>
        <li>Mayor Walsh committed $1 billion over ten years to bring Boston's school 
        buildings into the 21st Century, and this Capital Plan launches that investment 
        with funding for 21st Century Classrooms, MSBA Accelerated Repair Program 
        partnerships, completion of projects in the pipeline, and reserves for future 
        projects coming out of BuildBPS community engagement.</li>
        <li>Boston will invest $343 million over the next five years in implementing the 
        core initiatives outlined in Go Boston 2030: streets that are safer for all users 
        of our roads and sidewalks, particularly pedestrians and cyclists; travel that 
        is more reliable and predictable; and quality transportation choices that improve 
        access to interconnect our neighborhoods for all modes of travel.</li>
        <li>Through the use of Winthrop Square proceeds, City capital dollars, and 
        leveraging external funds, Mayor Walsh plans to carry out early actions to implement 
        Imagine Boston 2030’s Open Space goals, including investing in Franklin Park as a 
        keystone park for the city, completing the Emerald Necklace, and restoring Boston 
        Common to its full vibrancy.</li>
        </ul>
    - col: >
        <ul>
        <li>Boston will prepare for climate change by investing City dollars and outside 
        funding to develop more detailed climate plans for Boston neighborhoods, especially 
        those most at risk for coastal flooding, as recommended in Climate Ready Boston.</li>
        <li>The Percent for Art Program, funded for the first time in this Capital Plan, 
        demonstrates the City’s leadership and commitment to sustainable funding for the 
        arts by setting aside one percent of the City’s annual capital borrowing for the 
        commissioning of public art.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With investments in roads, bridges, schools, libraries, parks, firehouses, and 
        community centers, the Imagine Boston Capital Plan touches each neighborhood and shapes 
        a City that over 14,000 voices told us they want to see.</p>

      <p>This Capital Plan allows Boston to invest in BPS projects already in the pipeline:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Slated to be completed in winter of 2017/2018, the $73 million Dearborn STEM Academy will open for students in September 2018. The project, which leverages a projected $37 million match from the MSBA, is designed based upon a project-based learning curriculum, with an emphasis on STEM education.</li>
      <li>Over the next two years, the Eliot School construction projects will be completed. The new $23 million North Bennet Street building will welcome 5th to 8th graders this fall into a 21st century learning environment while this summer, the final phase of construction will begin at the Commercial Street building.</li>
      </ul>
  - col: >
      <ul>
      <li>The Capital Plan provides for Boston’s matching investment in the Josiah Quincy Upper School (JQUS) and Boston Arts Academy (BAA), which are collaborative projects with the Massachusetts School Building Authority (MSBA).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In total, Boston will invest more than $312 million in BPS capital projects over the next five years, with an additional $418 million committed for the following five years. When combined with projected MSBA matching funds, Boston is committing the $1 billion in BPS capital projects over ten years.</p>
