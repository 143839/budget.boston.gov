    body: >
      The City benefits from its strong financial policies and practices 
      and has recently been affirmed with triple A bond ratings from Moody’s 
      and Standard and Poor’s. Strong bond ratings are an assessment of the City’s 
      long-term financial stability and lower the cost of borrowing. <blockquote>As 
      the City borrows more over ten years to support investments in its schools, 
      debt service is projected to increase as well. In FY18 Debt Service is budgeted 
      at $185.6 million, a 6.1% increase over the previous year. </blockquote> For 
      further detail see the Capital Planning and Financial Management chapters of 
      this volume.
