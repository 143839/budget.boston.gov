      <p>Targeted funding across the district is critical to identiftying gaps, and making targeted investment to improve student outcomes and close achievement and opportunity gaps</p>
      <p>To that end, the FY19 budget increases proven programs to benefit more students and families:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>$1.2 million to support translations and interpretations for students with individualized education plans (IEPs) and their families.</li>
      <li>$700,000 to grow Excellence for All for the third year, serving 6th graders in both K-8 programs and extended to 6th graders for feeder middle schools. With a total investment of $2.6 million, this improves equity of access to rigorous academic programming.</li>
      <li>$500,000 to expand Becoming a Man, a school-based group counseling program that guides young men in 7-12th grades to learn, internalize and practice social cognitive skills, make responsible decisions for their future and become positive members of their school and community.</li>
      <li>$500,000 in curriculum investments and professional development for English language learner classrooms and teaching staff, investments in social and emotional learning curriculum for students in grades K-2, and expanding successful curriculum pilots.</li>
      </ul>
