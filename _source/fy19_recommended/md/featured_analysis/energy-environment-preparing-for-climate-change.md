      As part of Boston’s implementation of Imagine Boston 2030, Mayor Walsh’s FY19-23 
      Capital Plan includes investments to support a healthy environment, reduce energy
      consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, and prepare for climate change.
    description: >
      Building on the success of the first phase of Climate Ready Boston in East Boston and Charlestown, the capital plan will allocate an additional $1.6 million to further resiliency initiatives to protect the city and provide more detailed reviews of additional neighborhoods.

    body: >
      Through Renew Boston Trust, Boston will undertake renovation projects to reduce 
      City buildings’ energy consumption and capture the resulting financial savings. 
      The City plans to finance the program with general obligation bonds payable in part 
      with the financial savings resulting from reduced energy consumption. The City will 
      implement the program through contracts with Energy Service Companies (ESCOs) that 
      will provide financial guarantees that the energy savings generated by the projects 
      will be sufficient to cover anticipated debt service costs.
