            "During the period of 2006 to 2015, Massachusetts&rsquo; annualized growth rate of 1.3% in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by state ranked 13th out of all 50 states and DC, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). The state remains one of the richest in terms of its GDP per capita -- $64,017 in 2015 &ndash; 4th in the nation and 128% of the national average. ",

            "The unemployment rate had been decreasing for both the State and City. The rate in Massachusetts has since fallen to 3.1% as of December 2016, which is still slightly higher than the 2.6% seen in the year 2000; however, this is due to growth in the labor force. The state and local economies have regained all jobs lost during the recent recessions and have reached peaks. The City of Boston&rsquo;s unemployment rate has steadily fallen to 2.7% as of December 2016.",
            "Massachusetts wage and salary income in the fourth quarter of 2016 rose 4.3% over the same quarter 2016, continuing a trend of positive year-over-year quarterly growth rates since first quarter 2010. Earnings growth by industry grouping over the period of the last quarter in 2015 to 2016 was strongest in &ldquo;Utilities&rdquo; and &ldquo;Durable Good and Manufacturing&rdquo;, while &ldquo;Forestry, fishing, and related activities&rdquo; and &ldquo;State and Local&rdquo; showed the weakest growth during the same period.",
            "Massachusetts&rsquo; seasonally adjusted total personal income rose 4.1% from 2015 to 2016, 12th out of the 50 states and DC in terms of growth and just above the national average of 3.5%. ",
