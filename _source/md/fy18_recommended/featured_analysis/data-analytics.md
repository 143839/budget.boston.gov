OUR APPROACH
Executive Insight
One of our top priorities is providing City
leadership with performance data where and
when they need it. We provide the Mayor,
Cabinet Chiefs, and City leadership with
dashboards and reports that provide up-to-date
information so they can stay regularly informed
about the effectiveness of programs, day-to-day
operations, and progress toward accomplishing
strategic goals.
Optimizing Process
Along with building the tools to understand how
well the City is performing, we work
collaboratively across 14 Cabinets to help
identify pain points and develop immediate and
potential long-term performance and process
improvements. These direct engagements
create lasting improvements for the City.
Engaging with the Public
The public plays a critical role in our work. To
promote transparency, we publish City and
departmental performance scorecards so people
can see how the City is performing at delivering
services, and to encourage innovation, we share
our data so the public can create new tools and
propose new ways for the City to deliver
services.
ACCOMPLISHMENTS THIS YEAR
Continued Development of CityScore
Launched in January of 2016, CityScore is
designed to inform the Mayor, City managers,
and the public about quality of life and the
performance of City government by aggregating
key performance metrics into one number.
Over the course of the year, CityScore has
improved the efficiency of core City services,
including increased resources for emergency
medical services. Additionally, we developed a
toolkit this year to make CityScore shareable so
that any government or organization can
recognize the same benefits that we have here
in Boston. The toolkit can be found at:
github.com/CityOfBoston/CityScoreToolkit.
EMS Ambulance Allocation
We worked with Boston EMS to analyze how to
best allocate resources in response to a growing
call volume. Focusing on a subset of calls,
incidents, and outcomes over multiple years,
the analysis has prompted EMS to adjust the
priority of calls to increase resource availability
for higher-need medical incidents. We're also
investigating how to increase ambulance
response efficiency and levels of care for some
of the City's most vulnerable residents.
311 Call Center Improvements
After noticing the 311 Call Center's CityScore
was below 1, we worked with the team to build
dashboards and reports to better highlight
performance trends and more quickly identify
issues. To supplement these tools, we also
developed a broader performance improvement
strategy that aims to improve call center
efficiency and increase constituent satisfaction,
with implementation beginning in early 2017.
