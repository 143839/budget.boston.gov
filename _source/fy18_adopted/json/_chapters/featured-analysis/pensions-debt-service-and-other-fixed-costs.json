            "Due to generations of underfunding the City&rsquo;s pension obligations, the City&rsquo;s pension schedule requires a 9.5% increase this year. This budget again dedicates $40 million toward reducing the City&rsquo;s long term other post-employment benefits (OPEB) liability. Actively addressing the City&rsquo;s long-term liabilities is not only fiscally responsible, it is critical to maintaining Boston&rsquo;s AAA bond rating, which unlocks additional capacity to fund more capital projects.",

            "The City borrows every year to support investments in its roads, bridges, school buildings, parks and police and fire stations. Based on its AAA bond rating, the City has continued to benefit from favorable interest rates and its position as an attractive investment. This high bond rating will be integral to unlocking a $1 billion investment in Boston schools over the next 10 years.",
            "Even with the recent favorable borrowings, debt service costs are projected to increase by $10.6 million (6.1%) in FY18. "
