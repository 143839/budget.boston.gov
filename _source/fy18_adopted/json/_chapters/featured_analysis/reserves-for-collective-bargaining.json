            "Most union contracts in City departments expired in FY17. Salary increases in these agreements will have a major direct impact on dollars available in FY18 and in the upcoming years. The FY18 collective bargaining reserves, a $20 million reserve for Boston Public Schools and a $27 million reserve for City departments including the Public Health Commission, contain funding for successor agreements. These reserves account for $31 million of the growth in the FY18 Budget."
