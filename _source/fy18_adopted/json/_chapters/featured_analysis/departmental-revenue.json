The FY18 budget includes an additional $9.7 million identified in departmental revenues. In FY18, the Office of Budget Management will initiate a citywide review of collections. This City will also work to maximize federal health insurance reimbursements and address past due bills to recover revenue. ",
            "The largest revenue source in this category is Municipal Medicaid reimbursements for school health services. This federal reimbursement, administered by the State, began in FY94. The City received $7.1 million in FY15 and $8.2 million in FY16. Municipal Medicaid reimbursement is expected to reach budget of $7 million in FY17 and increase to $7.25 million in FY18. "
