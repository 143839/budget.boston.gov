            "The Debt Service budget supports borrowing to finance the City&rsquo;s capital plan. In FY18 Debt Service is budgeted at $185.6 million, a 6.1% increase over the previous year.",
            "The City benefits from its strong financial policies and practices and has recently been affirmed with triple A bond ratings from Moody&rsquo;s and Standard and Poor&rsquo;s. Strong bond ratings are an assessment of the City&rsquo;s long-term financial stability and lower the cost of borrowing. As the City borrows more over ten years to support investments in its schools, debt service is projected to increase as well. In FY18 Debt Service is budgeted at $185.6 million, a 6.1% increase over the previous year.",
