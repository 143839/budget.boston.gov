    body: >
      <p>With a growing population and changing neighborhoods, Boston needs a police force sized to meet the demands. In FY19, the City will grow the size of the police force by 30 officers to over 2,210 officers. These additional officers will boost the City's policing capacity to the largest level in over a decade.</p> 
      <p>Boston is a diverse city, and it needs a police force that respects and reflects all Bostonians. Building on the continued success of recruiting a diverse police cadet class in FY18, the FY19 budget adds another cadet class in spring 2019, the third cadet class. This addition of 20 cadets continues to provide a stable pipeline of diverse young people from our neighborhoods for future police officer classes.</p>
      <p>While specifics of its implementation are pending the results of findings of the Northeastern University analysis, to be completed in June, we have budgeted $2 million towards a phase-in of police worn body cameras.</p>

  - title: Reducing Response Times
    body: >
      <p>Mayor Walsh has made investing in EMS a priority since taking office. In FY17, the Mayor added 20 new EMTs which curbed the rising Priority 1 response times and reduced calls referred to private ambulances. In FY18, Mayor Walsh launched an innovative Community Assistance Team that uses data to change the way EMTs are deployed to areas including the Boston Common and Recovery Road to improve patient outcomes and ambulance utilization.</p>
      <p>The FY19 budget again adds 20 more new EMTs, bringing the total uniformed force to nearly 400 citywide. These crews will work in neighborhoods across the city to continue responding to the growing number of EMS calls. The FY19 budget will also include eight replacement ambulances to support the new EMTs. This commitment by Mayor Walsh will make real progress to ensuring a high-level of service for all neighborhoods, and aims to have ambulances arrive on scene for Priority 1 calls within six minutes of the initial call. This builds on the Mayors commitment to permanently increase EMS service in East Boston.</p>
