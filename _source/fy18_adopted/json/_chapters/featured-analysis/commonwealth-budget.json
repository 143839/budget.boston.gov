            "State aid to the City represents its second largest single source of general fund revenue, although it has been declining as a share of recurring revenue. The State also provides many grants that support city programs and expenditures. Often, changes to law or policy recommendations that affect City expenditures and revenue generating capacity occur within or alongside budget language. As a result, the state budget is of great interest to the City."
