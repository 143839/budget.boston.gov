      <h5>21st Century Schools Fund</h5>
      <p>The $13 million BuildBPS 21st Century Schools Fund is providing schools with 21st century tools, including new technology and comfortable, movable furniture. This initiative will promote learner-centric programs, benefit professional development, and provide greater flexibility in both current and future learning spaces. BPS will work with school leaders to complete these upgrades for the start of the 2018-19 school year.</p>
      <h5>Accelerated Repair Program</h5>
      <p>Boston has also successfully ramped up its efforts to leverage <a href="http://www.massschoolbuildings.org/programs/Accelerated_Repair">MSBA Accelerated 
      Repair Program (ARP)</a> dollars from the <a href="http://www.massschoolbuildings.org/">Massachusetts School Building Authority 
      (MSBA)</a> to provide much needed improvements to its schools. In FY18, Boston invested $16.9 million to unlock $22.8 million in grants from the MSBA to provide seven BPS schools with new windows replace roofs and boilers at five BPS schools. In FY19, BPS will invest $4.5 million to unlock a $7.1 million grant from the MSBA to replace roofs, boilers, or windows at six schools. The Mayor’s capital plan sets aside an additional $26.7 million over the next five years to position Boston to further leverage MSBA ARP dollars in the future.</p>
