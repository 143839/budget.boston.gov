      External funds are provided directly to BPS through formula grants (called 
      entitlements), competitive grants, reimbursement accounts, and other grants, 
      primarily from state and federal sources. 
    description: >
      These external funds are critical to the success of the district, but have 
      decreased to 11% of total funding in FY18 from 17% in FY12 (Figure 3). Decreased 
      external funding was identified as a challenge to BPS’s long-term financial 
      stability in the Long-Term Financial Plan. In recent years, the BPS budget 
      has relied on the increased City appropriation to help absorb these decreases. 
      <blockquote>Overall, BPS is expecting a decrease of $1.8 million, or 1.4%, 
      compared FY17.</blockquote>

      <h5>Title I entitlement grant</h5>
      <p>One of the largest sources of federal revenue for BPS is the Title I entitlement grant. 
      BPS is projecting $36.2 million in Title I revenue in FY18. The grant’s purpose is 
      to improve the academic achievement of the disadvantaged by ensuring that that all 
      students have an equal opportunity to obtain a high-quality education. The grant provides 
      direct funds to schools with higher levels of poverty. </p>

      <h5>Special education</h5>
      <p>BPS receives two external revenue sources to fund the district’s comprehensive special 
      education program. Through the Circuit Breaker reimbursements, the Commonwealth shares 
      the cost of educating students with disabilities once the cost to educate those students 
      exceeds a threshold amount. BPS is projected to receive approximately $15 million in 
      Circuit Breaker revenue in FY18.</p>
      <p>Additionally, funds provided through the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education 
      Act (IDEA) grant enable the district to provide special education in the least restrictive 
      environment possible for children with disabilities ages 3 through 21, and to provide 
      early intervention services for children from birth through age two. BPS is projecting 
      to receive $17.9 million, or a 3.7% increase in IDEA funds in FY18. </p>

      <h5>Help for turnaround schools</h5>
      <p>BPS anticipates $2.09 million in School Improvement Grants in FY18 from the 
      Commonwealth. This funding is provided to the lowest performing schools in BPS, also 
      known as turnaround schools, to extend the instructional day by at least 30 minutes, 
      hold an additional 100 professional development hours for teachers, and provide other 
      school based support, such as after school tutors and literacy coaches.</p>
      <p>In FY18, the district has applied for funding for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Grew Elementary;</li>
          <li>Dorchester Academy;</li>
          <li>Madison Park Technical Vocational High School;</li>
          <li>Excel High School; and</li>
          <li>Brighton High School.</li>
        </ul>  
  - col: >
      <h5>Additional funding</h5>
      <p>Although previous School Improvement Grants have expired, the district has shifted 
      these activities to the operating budget to continue the work of turning around low 
      performing schools. The FY18 budget includes an additional $750 thousand in funding 
      to transition the Dearborn and the Mattapan Early Elementary School where previous 
      School Improvement Grants have ended.</p>
      <p>As mentioned previously, an additional $1.25 million reserve will be set up for 
      Level 3, 4, and 5 schools that are experiencing declining enrollment.</p>
