            "Other Funds is a revenue category that includes both City and non-City sources.",
            "City sources of Other Funds include the Street Opening Account which funds the permanent repair of utility cuts and pavement restoration. Transfers from the Surplus Property Fund, Parking Meter Fund, and the General Fund are also categorized as Other Funds.",
            "In FY18, the City proposes transferring $45.4 million from the Parking Meter Fund to the Capital Grants Fund and appropriating it for 16 one-time capital projects, including the reconstruction of pathways around Jamaica Pond, a Crosswalk and Lane Marking Revitalization initiative, and the reconstruction of Beach Street. Using the Parking Meter Fund revenue in this way allows the City to make increased investments in infrastructure while increased investment in the BuildBPS program is supported by additional debt issuance. The constraints of the City&rsquo;s debt affordability policies, designed to limit pressure on debt service costs in the operating budget, limit the City&rsquo;s capacity to address both needs through debt issuance alone. This is an opportunity to use available Parking Meter Fund balances for investments in one-time projects aligned with Go Boston 2030, the City&rsquo;s transportation master plan. Through this appropriation, the City will address important transportation capital needs. ",
            "Non-City sources of Other Funds include grants from the Boston Planning and Development Agency for roadway construction or other capital projects, as is the case with Harrison Avenue and Connect Historic Boston. Other Funds also include incentive rebates provided by utilities to carry out energy efficiency projects. Altogether, these City and non-City sources of capital funds are estimated at $145.8 million."
