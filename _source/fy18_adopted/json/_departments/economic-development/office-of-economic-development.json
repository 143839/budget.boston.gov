At least 70 percent of CDBG funds must be used to benefit low- and moderate-income households. CDBG funds are used to produce and preserve affordable housing, revitalize neighborhood commercial districts, assist the renovation of non-profit facilities, improve vacant lots, promote and monitor fair housing activities, and assist non-profit organizations in the operation of emergency shelters, health care, child care, youth and adult literacy programs. CDBG funds cannot be used for general government services or to replace funding cuts from existing public service activities. The CDBG awards for FY13, FY14, and FY15 were $15,929,397, $16,834,371, and $16,390,443 respectively. The FY16 award is $16,101,121."

Section 108 funds are secured by the City through a pledge of its current and future CDBG grant awards. These funds are used for economic development projects. The Boston Invests in Growth Loan Fund is a $40 million HUD Section 108 funded loan pool designed to jumpstart well-financed construction projects, create jobs, and strengthen Boston&rsquo;s economy. This program is designed for large commercial projects in Boston that have both permanent financing and equity in place. Boston Invests will finance the gap that remains between the financing and equity and the total project cost, known as mezzanine financing. In addition, up to 10% of the loan pool will be set aside for smaller neighborhood based projects of at least 5,000 square feet, the underwriting criteria for which will be the same as for the larger loans but the interest rate charged as well as the additional interest paid at the end will be lower. Additionally, $2.5 million HUD Section 108 funded loan pool will be used for energy efficiency and to promote job creation. The Section 108 Spread Unrestricted Fund is income earned as a result of the interest spread between Section 108 loan repayments owed to DND by its borrowers and Section 108 repayments DND owes to HUD. In FY16, DND will use this source to fund Main Streets districts and Restore projects that do not meet CDBG eligibility requirements."
