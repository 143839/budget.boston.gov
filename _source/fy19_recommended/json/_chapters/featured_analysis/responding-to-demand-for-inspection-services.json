Comprehensive planning projects, which analyze a group of buildings or program needs, provide the groundwork for targeted investments in the categories of Upgrade and New/Major Renovations. Projects in this category include funds for design and engineering services related to the construction of a new North Washington Street bridge, which will help leverage state construction funds."
