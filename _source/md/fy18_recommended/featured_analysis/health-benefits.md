      The City continues to benefit from health care cost reforms 
      achieved by the Walsh Administration in the 2015 - 2020 Public 
      Employee Committee (PEC) Agreement, which is projected to save 
      an additional $45 million over five years. 
    description: >
      Based on savings included in this agreement, Boston will realize $10 
      million in avoided health care costs in FY18, $2.6 million of 
      which are related to FY18 specific changes. <blockquote>Despite this 
      success, health care costs have continued to increase, since FY16, 
      at a rate higher than the overall budget, consistent with trends 
      in the broader Massachusetts market.</blockquote>

  - title: FY18 Budget
    body: >
      The FY18 budget includes $395 million for all health benefit related 
      costs for the City’s employees and retirees, comprising 12.6% of 
      total City expenditures – compared to 8% in 2001.
      <ul>
      <li>$42.25 million of these costs for future OPEB liabilities are 
      discussed in more detail in the following section.</li>
      <li>$353 million for current health, dental and life premiums 
      and employer Medicare payroll taxes are addressed below.</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>Growing costs</h5>
      <p>As shown in Figure 7, annual costs for health, dental and life 
      insurance and Medicare taxes grew from $132 million in FY01 to $353 
      million in FY18, an increase of $221 million or 168%. Over the same 
      period, all other City costs increased 80%. Figure 7 shows three 
      distinct periods of annual cost increases. Steep increases averaged 
      15% per year from FY01 – FY08. Between FY09 – FY15 these cost increases 
      dropped to an average increase of 1% per year due to multiple factors.</p>
  - col: >
      <h5>These factors include:</h5>
      <ul>
      <li>state health reform legislation;</li>
      <li>cooperative efforts by the City and its unions to reduce 
      both the City’s share of costs and total costs; and</li>
      <li>lower nationwide health care cost trends.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Beginning in FY16, higher health care claims costs led to higher 
      premium increases, which were mitigated by PEC agreement savings, 
      resulting in an average cost increase of 6.4%.</p>

    body: >
      Municipal health care reform legislation, passed by the State legislature in 2011 provided municipalities more freedom in health plan design, and also mandated that all Medicare-eligible municipal retirees enroll in Medicare Part B and a City sponsored Medicare supplement plan. <blockquote>As a direct result of mandated Medicare enrollment, approximately 5,500 additional City retirees and their spouses have enrolled in Medicare supplement plans.</blockquote>
- text_col_2:
  - col: >
      <h5>City savings</h5>
      <p>Benefits for these plans are comparable to non-Medicare plans but costs are lower due to Medicare reimbursements. Over 70% of retirees and spouses are now enrolled in Medicare plans, compared to just 37% prior to the legislation. City savings from this mandate, beginning in FY13, have totaled approximately $20 million annually – a major contributor to the total cost decrease in FY13. City retirees and their beneficiaries are eligible for Medicare through payment of Medicare payroll taxes during their working career.</p>

      <h5>Medicare taxes</h5>
      <p>Medicare taxes are paid for all City employees who were hired after March 1986.
      City Medicare taxes, totaling $19.3 million in the FY18 budget, have increased an 
      average 12% annually since FY01. This growth is due to increases in total payroll
      and also the increasing percentage of total employees who were hired after March 
      1986 and are impacted by the tax.  Also, more Medicare eligible employees are 
      now beginning to retire, which will continue to increase the percentage of all 
      retirees who will be enrolling into Medicare plans.</p>

      <h5>Bargaining discussions</h5>
      <p>Assisted by 2011 Municipal Health Care Reform, the City adopted MGL Chapter 32B S.19 and began working closely with its thirty six unions, as represented through the Public Employee Committee (PEC), in making health care changes. Through the City and PEC’s two coalition bargaining agreements signed in 2011 and 2015, City employees and retirees are now paying a higher share of total health care costs through increased premium share and higher co-pays for office visits and pharmaceutical costs.</p>
  - col: >
      <h5>Reduced City share</h5>
      <p>The City’s share of total costs for its most popular non-Medicare health plan reduced from approximately 82% in FY11 to 77% in FY18. This is still higher than the estimated 69% employer share for a state employee enrolled in the Group Insurance Commission (GIC). <blockquote>Today, the City’s total annual health care costs are estimated to be over $26 million lower than they would have been if not for these changes.</blockquote></p>

  - title: Containing total costs
    body: >
      In FY15, the City and the PEC entered into their second agreement, which is projected to reduce projected costs by approximately $45 million over five years. This most recent agreement is unique because it includes not only a continued increase in member cost share, but also multiple other approaches to containing total costs for both the City and members, including:
- text_col_2:
  - col: >
      <ul>
      <li>Competitive bidding and refinement of the City’s health plan options. After the elimination of a costly indemnity plan in FY12 saving several million dollars annually, non-Medicare health plan options were further reduced in FY16 to three plans: one PPO (Indemnity) with an open provider network and two HMO managed plans with a local provider network. Savings of over $1 million dollars per year in administrative fees were realized from this change which is shared by both employees and the City. <blockquote>Also, effective July 1, 2017 the City’s most expensive Medicare Plan, Master Medical, will be closed to new enrollment and ultimately replaced with an alternative BCBS Medicare product.</blockquote></li>
      </ul>
  - col: >
      <ul>
      <li>The FY15 PEC agreement continued to prioritize funding of health care costs through self-insurance wherever possible. In FY13 the City began self-insuring most of its health plans, reducing total costs by over $10 million per year.</li>
      <li>In FY16, the City and the PEC began analyzing options for more cost effective management of the City’s prescription benefits which now total roughly $100 million per year for all plans. As a result, a new Medicare product will be offered that includes a lower cost Medicare prescription drug plan, which is projected to save the City $2.7 million per year when implemented. The City and PEC will also continue to analyze options for carving out prescription drug management through a separate contract, as well as rebidding of the City’s six Medicare plans.</li>
      </ul>
- text_block:
  - title: Health Claims Trends
    body: >
      <p>Nationally, lower health claims costs contributed to lower premium increases from FY11 – FY14, which were followed by higher premium increases in FY16 and FY17 largely due to pharmaceutical costs. The City is limited in its ability to influence the multiple causes behind health care cost swings, which can include:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>increasing medical provider charges;</li>
      <li>an aging population;</li>
      <li>overuse of certain services; and</li>
      <li>high utilization of more expensive hospitals.;</li>
      </ul>
