            "Over the course of FY17, CityScore has contributed to a number of City achievements, including:",
            "A 10% increase in the number of traffic signals repaired, resulting in safer and more efficient streets;",
            "A 5% increase in the average number of calls answered within 30 seconds at the 311 Call Center, resulting in more expedient customer service for those interacting with the City; and",
            "A 6% increase in the speedy removal of graffiti, helping to beautify our neighborhoods. ",
            "In addition to assisting with improving services, the City launched a new, user-friendly website allowing the public to track the City&rsquo;s score. In FY18, the City will continue to develop and expand CityScore by incorporating additional metrics and identifying new opportunities to improve the quality of life for those in Boston. "
