      Commonwealth charter schools, which are granted charters by the 
      State Board of Education, are publicly funded schools administered 
      independently from local school committee and district bargaining rules 
      and regulations.
    description: >
      Commonwealth charter schools are primarily financed by the home districts 
      of their students through a per pupil based charge. They are projected to 
      educate 10,660 Boston students in FY18. Boston is assessed by 
      the Commonwealth to fund charter schools on a per pupil basis, and Boston’s 
      charter school tuition assessment is projected to increase by $17.5 million 
      over the FY17 budget. <blockquote>Boston’s charter school assessment has risen 
      by 155% since the enactment of the 2010 Achievement Gap Legislation.</blockquote>
